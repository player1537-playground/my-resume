<p>Several friends and I made this game as part of the Technology Student Association (TSA) Video Game Design (VGD) competition that we compete in each year.  The goal of the competition is to get students to become interested in programming and game design.  During our freshman year of high school, we made a very simple game in .NET with C# and the XNA framework.  It consisted of a hand-coded "slideshow" software with math puzzles throughout, as well as an interesting storyline and voice acting throughout.  With this game, we won 1st place in both the regional and state competitions.</p>
<p>We learned about the importance of having more than one person who can program on the team because of issues that arose when school work became overwhelming for me.  Additionally, we found that none of us were huge fans of C# and the difficulty of creating a fully cross-platform game with C# that could comply with one of the contest's restrictions: the game must be able to run without having to install anything.</p>
