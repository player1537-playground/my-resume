<p>I am Tanner Hobson, a rising senior at Farragut High School who has been studying programming since 7th grade.  I have been formally taught in my school's Software Design and AP Computer Science classes (the latter of which I earned a 5 on the AP exam).  I have also listened in on several high performance computing lectures at ORNL during my internship with JICS/NICS.  These lectures covered topics ranging from simple command line navigation to high performance computing with the R programming language and a recap of a GPU programming conference.  Additionally, I have done several years of FIRST Robotics &mdash; programming in LabVIEW one year and Java the other.  I have also participated in the Technology Student Association's (TSA) Video Game Design competition &mdash; where our school's team has earned a superior ranking several years &mdash; and Open Source Software &mdash; which was created this past year and we earned first place at both Regional and State competitions.</p>
<p>The programming languages which I feel the most comfortable in are: Bash, C, Java, Perl, and Scheme.  These are languages which I regularly use to aid with command line navigation, data manipulation/number crunching, and testing new concepts.  I am also familiar with other languages that I do not use very often: C#, Forth, J, JavaScript, LabVIEW, Lisp, PHP, Python, R, Z80 Assembly.  I have learned the basics of these &mdash; enough to be able to do some programming &mdash; but I would need to search for most of the standard library functions in order to complete several problems.</p>
