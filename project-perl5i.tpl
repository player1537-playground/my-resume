<p>I worked on this project during the 2012 Google Code-In competition.  The goal of the project was to "Fix as much of Perl 5 as possible in one pragma."  I played a very small role in working on this one, and mainly worked on a few autoboxed methods for arrays, such as implementing rotate and a few push and pop methods, and discussing with the project owners about what the best and least surprising way to implement everything was.  I learned about how to work with people across the internet through Github and about list and scalar contexts for Perl.</p>
